# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Analysing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.

PySpark to perform ETL on a dataset of roughly 50 reviews of items in the "Lawn & Garden" catergory of Amazon. 

### Purpose
 youâ€™ll use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

## Analysis
I used PySpark to perform my analysis and pulled the dataset from a S3 Bucket I set up on my Amazon AWS account. 

To improve the reliablity of the data set I removed all reviewers that had less than 20 reviews. To futher improve the data I removed any reviewers that provided more unhelpful votes than not. 

At that point I plit the data into the vine [paid_reviews] and non-vine [unpaid_reviews]reviews and gathered the results. 

## Results
*Total number of Vine Reviews = 452
